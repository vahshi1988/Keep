# Template for a elinks.conf file
#
# This file was contributed by David Mediavilla
# <r96x6a79yki40001@sneakemail.com>. Note that it's not up-to-date now, as
# some more keyboard actions were added in ELinks. So, if you don't see your
# faviourite action here, don't panic yet and try to look it up in
# src/config/kbdbind.c.
#
####
#
# Simple HOWTO for keybinding by Peter Wang:
#
# Create a `elinks.conf' file wherever your `elinks.conf' usually goes.
# 
# Binding is done with a statement like so:
#
#    bind "KEYMAP" "KEYSTROKE" = "ACTION"
#
# where:  
#        
# - keymap is "main" or "edit"
#
# - keystroke is a case sensitive key, which you can prefix with
# "Ctrl-" or "Alt-"
# 
# DME: I read that with Ctrl- the key must be uppercase
#
# - action is one of the things you find in `kbdbind.c' (`parse_act'
# function).  You'll need to grep around the source to see what
# each one does, or guess, or ask.
