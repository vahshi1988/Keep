# This file is used by psad to elevate/decrease the danger levels of IP
# addresses (or networks in CIDR notation) so that psad does not have to
# apply the normal signature logic.  This is useful if certain IP addresses
# or networks are known trouble makers and should automatically be assigned
# higher danger levels than would normally be assigned.  Also, psad can be
# made to ignore certain IP addresses or networks if a danger level of "0" is
# specified.  Optionally, danger levels for IPs/networks can be influenced
# based on protocol (tcp, udp, icmp).

#  <IP address>  <danger level>  <optional protocol>/<optional ports>;

# Examples:
#
#  10.111.21.23     5;                # Very bad IP.
#  127.0.0.1        0;                # Ignore this IP.
#  10.10.1.0/24     0;                # Ignore traffic from this entire class C.
#  192.168.10.4     3    tcp;         # Assign danger level 3 if protocol is tcp.
#  10.10.1.0/24     3    tcp/1-1024;  # Danger level 3 for tcp port range
